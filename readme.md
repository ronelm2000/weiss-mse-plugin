Weiss Schwarz Â©bushiroad All Rights Reserved.

This plugin for MSE2 (or Magic Set Editor 2) is designed to make custom cards for Weiss Schwarz, a TCG from Bushiroad. There's actually 2 major card forks for this plugin; one is by Benitez and is currently developed by Chairman, and the other (which is the the older one from sion) is currently this fork.

This fork supports the newest mechanics, including "Link", "Choice", "Replay", "Standby", three traits, long 2nd trait, etc.. This fork also supports the JP Text Name bar found exclusively in English Imported Sets using the latest style from Chainsaw Man English Edition, as well as importing sets from Benitez (but with some missing data). This set also supports foil/SP mechanics, but not SEC.

## Known Issues
#### I cannot type in Korean/Japanese!
This has been reported to be a [known issue](https://github.com/twanvl/MagicSetEditor2/issues/121) in MSE 2.1.2. In order to resolve this issue, please instead download [this version of MSE](https://github.com/haganbmj/MagicSetEditor2/releases/tag/v2.2.2) while waiting for an update that hopefully fixes the issue. I have not created this plugin with these languages in mind tho, so if you need to request some adjustments, please file a issue and attach your `.mse-set` file so I can work on it.

#### I changed the one of the styles options but my changes did not persist!
This is a minor UI issue caused by MSE not updating the card UI when going from Style to Card. As long as you click on the Rules Text your changes should be reflected.
